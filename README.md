# Pomodoro Timer ⏲️🍅

## Overview 📚
The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. It helps improve focus and efficiency by breaking work into 25-minute intervals called "Pomodoros," followed by short breaks. After completing four Pomodoros, a longer break is taken. This technique is widely used to enhance focus and prevent burnout, ensuring balanced work and rest.

## Features 🚀
- **Pomodoro timer**: Focus on a task for 25 minutes ⏰.
- **Short breaks**: 5-minute break between Pomodoros to refresh 🧘.
- **Long break**: 15-30 minute break after every 4 Pomodoros 🛌.
- **Customizable timer**: Set your own Pomodoro and break intervals 🔧.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. **Start a Pomodoro**: The timer counts down for 25 minutes, during which you should work on a task without distractions 💻.
2. **Short Break**: After the Pomodoro ends, a 5-minute break is initiated to relax ☕.
3. **Long Break**: After completing 4 Pomodoros, a longer break of 15-30 minutes is taken to recharge before starting the next round 🧠.
